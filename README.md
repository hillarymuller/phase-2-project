# VACATION BABIES RENTALS

## Description
I was speaking with a friend the other day about all the special things she has to purchase to travel with her child, only for her to outgrow them by the next vacation. This inspired me to build an app where parents can rent items for vacation so they don't have to spend as much money or have a ton of clutter sitting around. 

The app is in the glorious color scheme of CoppertoneÂ® WaterBabies sunscreen we used in the 90s and allows users to:
- Add new items for rent
- Delete items
- Favorite items
- Add items to their bag
- View the bag
- View the entire list of items & sort it by price or location
- Filter the list of items by category
- Search for an item
- Filter, sort, or search within their bag
- View details about a single item

Each of the images comes directly from the Amazon listing for that item and I'd like to thank my friend Chelsea Spickelmier for sending me an extensive list of Amazon links for these items & more!

Additional features to add in the future could include:
- Ability to remove items from bag
- Log in to see saved items & past rentals
- A home page with testimonials/photos from users

## Installation
1. Fork & clone the repo.
2. Run npm install to install dependencies.
3. Run npm run server.
4. In a second terminal, run npm start to run the application.
5. Enjoy!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
